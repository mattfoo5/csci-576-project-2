CSCI 576 Assignment 2


Compile program by typing javac MyCompression.java



Run program by typing java MyCompression file M N. Program will only work if M = 2 because extra credit portion was not completed. According to discussion posts, code will be tested on one channel files only. Thus, only functionality for one channel files was implemented. 


Examples of input parameters

file = image1-onechannel.rgb
M = 2
N = 16


Example of full valid command:

java MyCompression image1-onechannel.rgb 2 16
